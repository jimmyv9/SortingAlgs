# SortingAlgs
Project in Data Structures and Algorithms coded in C++ which computes the average runtime of specific sorting algorithms.
The program at first sorts a vector of size 1000 for all 4 sorting algorithms used (Merge, Insert, Bubble and Quick sort). Then, the user is prompted to pick a specic sorting algorithm and calculate its average runtime for any sized-vector for any amount of simulations.

SortingAlgs.h: Contains the 4 sorting algorithms used in this project

main.cpp: Generates vectors of size N and computes each specific algorithm's runtime average
